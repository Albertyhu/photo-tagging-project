This is an Easter Hunt game built with React JS and Firebase. 
The object of the game is the find all characters inside picture.
Once a character is found, a marker will be placed on that character. 
The locations of the characters are stored in Firestore and once the browser loads, the app will pull data of the location from Firebase.
The live version of the app can be viewed here:
